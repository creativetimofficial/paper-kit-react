      <p>This is the demo bottom navigation.</p>
      <p>
        On the left, it has some links that redirect to our platform, and on the
        right, it has a small copyright.

      <p>It was designed to be as simple as it may.</p>
      <p>
        Everything in this component is static, so you will need to manually
        change things if you want, so feel free to change this component as you
        wish.
